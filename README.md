# Hypothesis Testing with Insurance Data 
 
I have been asked to use my hypothesis testing skills to answer the following questions:

- Q1. Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?
- Q2. Are men more likely to smoke than women?
- Q3. Do different regions have different charges, on average?



For each question, I must:

* State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
* Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples
* Test the assumptions of your selected test.
* Execute the selected test, or the alternative test (if you do not meet the assumptions)
* Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis 
* Show a supporting visualization that helps display the result
